# Classification-of-TE2-Sudokus
### BpB classification of T&amp;E(2) 9x9 Sudokus
The concepts and theories necessary to understand this repository — in particular braids[p], the T&amp;E(n) procedure, the T&amp;E-depth of a puzzle and the BpB classification of puzzles in T&E(2) — were first defined in [CRT] and then reproduced in all the editions of [PBCS].<br>
[HCCS] includes a summary presentation of  them.<br>
General conclusions drawn from the detailed classifications below are available in [HCCS].<br><br>

### Contents of this repository
Currently, the main contents of this repository is a unique folder, eleven-26370.<br>
More folders with similar results might be added later to this repository, when more T&E(2) puzzles are found.<br><br>

The eleven-26370 folder includes: <br>
- the list [eleven 2011b] of 26,370 puzzles created by "eleven" according to the principles defined in [eleven 2011a]; they are pattern independent – the main reason why we chose this collection in [PBCS] and why we keep using it here and in [HCCS] as our reference for T&E(2) puzzles; the original link to the puzzles having been lost, they are reproduced here with eleven's agreement;<br>
- the sudo-eleven.pdf document ("Hardest Sudokus", May 27, 2011), a detailed presentation of the construction method and a complement to [eleven 2011a];<br>
- the BpB.txt file, containing the BpB classifications of all these puzzles — the main motivation for creating this repository; all computations were done with the [SHC] software;<br>
- the SER.txt file, containing the SER ratings of all these puzzles, mainly used in [HCCS] to compute the vague correlation between the SER and the BpB classification.<br>

Results computed with [SudoRules] for a sublist of 1,278 puzzles were published as Table 11.2 and followig remarks in [PBCS]; they were used to check that the [SudoRules] and [SHC] results coincided.<br>
The detailed results given here for the full list of puzzles were used in Table 2.2 of [HCCS], an extension of Table 11.2 of [PBCS].<br><br>
