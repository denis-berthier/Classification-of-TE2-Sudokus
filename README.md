# Classification-of-TE2-Sudokus
### BpB classification of T&amp;E(2) 9x9 Sudokus
The definitions necessary to understand this repository — i.e. braids[p], the T&amp;E(n) procedure, the T&amp;E-depth of a puzzle and the BpB classification of puzzles in T&E(2) — were first given in [CRT] and reproduced in [PBCS].<br>
[HCCS] includes a summary presentation of  them.<br>
Conclusions drawn from the detailed classifications below are available in [HCCS].<br><br>
